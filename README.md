Visual Studio Extension: Run On Save
====================================

A simple Visual Studio extension that calls [dotnet-csharpier](https://github.com/belav/csharpier) on C# files, whenever they're saved in visual studio.

Right now, it's hard-coded to run dotnet-csharpier, though it shouldn't be too hard to parameterize it to run other command line applications too, maybe via a configuration file that can be version controlled?
